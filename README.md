# Password Generator

https://nikitaaa95.github.io/Password-Generator

## Description

The purpose of this site is for the user to come to the site and build a non-predictive password
 meeting the criteria they need for any third party program they might be using. The site is 
 seeking to relieve the user from the work of creating that password.

I learned a lot more about Arrays and establishing strings, but I will be looking to 
learn more as there are things to improve with the site. The code works in theater and was working 
in my test with simpler values, but I can't figure out why it isn't working now.

## Usage

The user can click the "Generate Password" button. Then they will be prompted by a series of 
queries to define their password requirements. Once they've gone through the prompts, the 
site should provide them with a valid password.
